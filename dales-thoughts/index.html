                    <p class="first">Welcome to my brain.</p>
                    <p>Seriously. Not literally, but seriously.</p>
                    <p>This site contains most everything I think about. First and foremost, God. After that I fill this website with things that I'm passionate about, videos, photographs, graphic design, and many other assorted thoughts. And I'm very excited to show you all that I care about.</p>
                    <p>My blog is the reason I even started looking into my own webpage. I kept writing my thoughts about God on Facebook, and when I continually had to cut down on the length of my posts to fit into a status, I decided I would like to start my own page. That resulted in a humble, little blog based on Google's Blogger. After writing my musings there for close to two and a half years, I was presented with an opportunity to get my own website. I jumped on it, and this is what came out of it. I find it much more personal, and it makes me a lot more excited and passionate about the things I've got to show you.</p>
                    <p>This new site contains much more than the old site, including video projects, some photographic deliberations, and random graphic designs which have much improvement to be made.</p>
                    <p>Hey, as much as I may not be professional (yet, anyway), I'd like to thank you for stopping by and caring, even if that means letting me know where I could improve.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy!</p>
