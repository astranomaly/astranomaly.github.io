                                <p>[If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/37119711">this video</a>. It's worth a half hour of your time; just make sure you do it when it makes sense.]</p>
                                <p>There are several people I know who are very solid intellects. They have valid points when discussing this video including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Invisible Children is known to "waste" donated money</li>
                                    <li>IC spends less than 31% of their budget on putting money towards direct aid.</li>
                                    <li>IC won't report to Better Business Bureau or Foreign Affairs</li>
                                    <li>IC is an extremely shady nonprofit that has been called "misleading", "naive", and "dangerous by a Yale political science professor.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If you want to support this problem the "American" way and just throw your money at the problem, please spend the next few minutes on Google finding a less shady company to donate your money to. You can stop reading now, if you are one of those.</p>
                                <p>Invisible Children is taking a different approach, though. They admit right at the beginning of the video that they are more interested in raising awareness, which they did explosively. (Over 50 million views in 3 days on Vimeo and YouTube combined) And people are discussing it left right and center; exactly what was supposed to happen. IC is getting more money to do exactly what they've been doing, raising awareness from the "people who have lost common sense". "Smart" people are donating to "less shady" causes, and they're doing their part to stop Kony. And the people who actually listened to IC's message and heard what they were actually saying are jumping to action by raising awareness to the leaders and peers around them.</p>
                                <p>One last point I'd like to talk about is military intervention. A few skeptics, who would probably be shunned by all other skeptics, have said that what IC is trying to do is going to cause Rwanda II. HUGE assumption. And you know what happens when you assume; you make an "ass" out of "u" and "me".</p>
                                <p>"Learn a little bit about the complexities of the region's ongoing strife before advocating for direct military intervention." Absolute truth, once again; but a lot of people are taking this to mean Rwanda 2.0. IC has said that they want the US and other allied militaries involved to support what's already going on. This isn't some offensive military front that's primary goal is to fight like its a war. Take note of the word "intervention"; this is a tactical operation to take down an "organized rebellion", furthermore, Mr. Kony himself.</p>
                                <p>So please know that Invisible Children has already done more with their "loosely" used money to help the cause in Uganda than most skeptics assume. They have taken a mostly ignorant Westernized culture and united them (even if only for a matter of time) to think about and for the most part legitimately want to help an injustice in the world. And remember, IC is asking for action; if you want to toss some money, maybe you should look into more charities, but remember what IC just accomplished.</p>

                        	<h3>Grace Like An Ocean</h3><img src="img/line.gif" alt="divider" class="subdivider" /><br>
                            <section class="second">
                                <p>One of my favorite worship songs of all time is "<em>How He Loves</em>" by <strong>David Crowder Band</strong>. Don't ask me why, cause I don't know. It's not like it's somehow better than other worship songs because of the perfect lyrics, or amazing chord progression, or even the perfect use of the minor chords in the second chorus.</p>
                                <p>I think the reason that I like this song so much is because of the complete honesty of David Crowder. I read his book, "Praise Habit" and it blew me away. It completely redefined the meaning of praise in my life. It seems to me that he lives up to the name David; just as King David searched after God with his whole heart, so I believe that David Crowder does as well.</p>
                                <p>There are also a couple lines in the song that get me every time.</p>
                                <blockquote>"...drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes.<br>
                                If his grace is an ocean we're all sinking.<br>
                                So heaven meets earth like a unforeseen kiss<br>
                                and my heart turns violently inside of my chest<br>
                                I don't have time to maintain these regrets<br>
                                when I think about the way<br>
                                He loves us!"</blockquote>
                                <p>Grace like an ocean. I just love it. We take it as a metaphor, but it's actually true. We are completely drowning in his grace. He has given us so much more than we can possibly take in. But we don't have time to maintain our regrets when in God's grace, cause that grace already covers any regrets we could have, so it just simply makes more sense to praise him.</p>

                            	<h3>The Mind That Wouldn't Shut Up</h3><img src="img/line.gif" alt="divider" class="subdivider" /><br>
                                <section class="second">
                                	<p>Have you ever wished that your mind would just shut up? I certainly have. Like today, all day. It's so brutal. I'm thinking and thinking and thinking; which, I mean, isn't all bad, but I just can't really come up with anything positive. My mind just doubts everything and tries to come up with reasons why things won't work.</p>
                                    <p>And I hate it when I see that kind of stuff in other people. Like when a group is brainstorming, and somebody just snuffs out every idea right when it comes out; and then, or course, nobody even wants to have any ideas.</p>
                                    <p>I work towards making sure I'm not that person. Admittedly, I ain't perfect at it yet. But it's certainly nice to know that not every person I meet will be pissed off at how pessimistic I am.</p>
                                    <p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is that really no matter the situation, try to be positive. Like just live life, be happy, and be respectful, honoring, caring, loving, etc., etc., etc. to everyone else.</p>
                                    <p>The Golden Rule would apply pretty good here, eh?</p>
                                    <blockquote><p><strong>Matthew 7:12</strong></p>
                                    So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</blockquote>
