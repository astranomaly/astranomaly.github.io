                	<h1>About</h1><img src="img/line.gif" alt="divider" /><br>
                	<p class="first">I am <em>Dale Mich√®l Reimer</em>, and despite what my name may imply I am not French; I am a Mennonite from two Mennonite parents, Bruce and Evalina Reimer. I currently live in <em>Morweena, MB</em> which has been put on the map by my cousin James Reimer who is currently tending the net for the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
                    <p class="imgHover" id="dalesFace"></p><p>So anyways, I'm <em>17</em>, attending Grade 12 at Morweena Christian School, and planning to graduate in 2012. In the future, I hope to be involved in <em>film-making</em>. It has been an evolving passion of mine, and I love to express things with vivid imagery. I am really getting into the whole video producing/directing/editing part of film-making. I love making shorts that are really quite random and humorous; but I would also like to get into producing more serious shorts and eventually get my name on a couple of features.</p>
                    <p>Even though I really enjoy sitting down and thinking with a nice hot beverage, I do have a very random side that I release to my dearest friends (who probably think I'm a two-faced freak). I love being a solid guy for my friends, but I will never try to be too serious. I like to play <em>hockey</em>, and other various sports, and although I try not to be competitive, when I get into a game I can get pretty heated. I enjoy playing the <em>guitar</em>, especially for praise and worship purposes.</p>
                    <p>I can't wait to move out of the house. It may sound a little strange at first that such an obedient child (tongue firmly in cheek) would want to leave his parents, but I really look forward to living on my own, making my own decisions and discovering what life is all about through my own journey. Currently, my plans are to attend School of Ministers at Southland Church in Steinbach, MB September 2012 - April 2013. I'm looking forward to <em>experiencing God</em> in more ways and learning foundational stuff to use for the rest of my life. </p>
