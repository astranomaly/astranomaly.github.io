                <p>Well, this site is owned and operated and designed and maintained and updated and ignored by one Jonathan J. Reimer, as you likely are aware by this point. If you haven't been aware, then I can only assume you have a large strip of duct tape covering the top 2/3 of your computer monitor, and are thereby unable to see the header image.</p>
                <p>Anyway this curious fellow is known to attend a certain <em>Art Institute</em> in <em>Vancouver</em>, <em>B.C</em>, Canada in order to learn more about making websites and all the shiny things like that. He grew up in Ontario, moved to Saskatchewan (just in time to experience a winter there), moved to Alberta, and has continued moving west. It is assumed that one day he will end up in Siberia.

Jon does not mind long walks on the beach, but prefers long walks in the forest or mountains, as hiking is pretty much the greatest thing ever. He makes music and art all the time, and would probably die if he wasn't able to.</p>
